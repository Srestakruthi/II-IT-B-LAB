# AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT: to arrange the given array in sorted order using selection sort
## DESCRIPTION: Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part is the entire list.
### STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE: 
1. We have to declare an array to be sorted.
2. Check whether the given array is sorted or not.
3. If it is not sorted, then compare each element with the remaining elements.
4. If the element is greater than the other elements then we have to interchange the elements position.
5. This process contiues till all the elements of the given array are sorted.
#### OUTPUT OBTAINED:
