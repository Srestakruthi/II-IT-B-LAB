# AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT : Arranging the given elements in sorted array using bubblesort.
## DESCRIPTION :
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
### STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE :
1. Declare an array with specific number of elements.
2. Then starting from the initial position, compare the adjacent elements.
3. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them. If not, compare the next two adjacent elements.
4. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
5. Once the array is sorted, print the sorted array.
#### OUTPUT OBTAINED:
OUTPUT 1:When we input the array elements as {15, 13, 29, 3, 12} by going through the bubble sort function it checks whether the given array is sorted or not.If it is not sorted, then the ajacent elements are compared and get swapped if the first element is greater the next element and continues till the entire array is sorted and gives the output as
{3, 12, 13, 15, 29}

OUTPUT 2 : When we input the array elements as {15, 13, 29, 3, 12, -1,7, -9, 99, 56} by going through the bubble sort function it checks whether the given array is sorted or not. If it is not sorted, then the adjacent elements are compared and get swapped if the first element is greater than next element and continues till the entire array is sorted and gives the output as {-9, -1, 3, 7, 12, 13, 15, 29, 56, 99}. In this case we can see that negative elements are also sorted.

OUTPUT 3 : When we input the array elements as {1, 13, 57, 64, 92} by going through the bubble sort function, it checks whether the given array is sorted or not. Here we have already given a sorted array. So we get the output as {1, 13, 57, 64, 92}.
