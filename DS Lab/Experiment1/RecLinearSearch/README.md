# Linear Search with Recursion
## AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT : To find an element in an array using linear search using recursion
### DESCRIPTION : We have to write a C program to find whether the element is present in an array. If it is present, we can find the position of the element in an array using linear search using recursion.
#### STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE :
1. Declare the function RecLinearSearch which takes 4 input parameters and returns position of an element which is searched by the user
2. Create an array and input the elements of the array and scan the value of the key element to be found
3. The idea is to compare the key with first element in a[]. If the element is found at first position, return it.
4. Else recur for the remaining array and the key value.
5. If the element is found, it prints the value of the index at which key element is found. Otherwise,it prints the element is not found.
  
  
OUTPUT 1 (If the input is 15): when the user inputs the key value to be searched as 15, the output is obtained as element is found at position 6.

OUTPUT 2 ( If the input is 99): when the user inputs the key value to be searched as 99, it prints the element is not found since no match for the element is found.
