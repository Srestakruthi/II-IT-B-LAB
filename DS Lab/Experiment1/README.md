# EXPERIMENT 1 : Linear Search without recursion
## AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT : To find an element in an array using Linear Search without recursion (Iterative)
### DESCRIPTION : Linear Search is to find whether an element is present in an array or not. If it is present, then at what location.
#### STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE :
1. Declare an array 'a' of size 10 and enter the elements of the array.
2. Scan for the value of key element to be found.
3. Then using for loop, in every iteration compare the key element to be found with the current element.
4. If the values matches then return the current index value of the array. If the values doesnot match move on to the next element of the array.
5. If no match is found then print the element is not found.
6. For the given array a[10] = {11,7,9,16,21,4,15,98,67,31}



Output 1 (if the input is 15) :
If the key value to be found is given as 15, then it prints the element is found at index 6.

Output 2 (If the input is 99):
If the key value to be found is 99, then it prints that element is not found.Since no match is found.
